| GUI | Wails v2 desktop app |
| CLI | Cobra-based thin HTTP client |
| Build | `CGO_ENABLED=1 go build ./...` |
| Test | `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race -count=1 ./...` |
| Lint | `go vet ./...` |
| Error convention | `fmt.Errorf("package: operation: %w", err)` |

### Architecture layers

```
internal/adapters/inbound/   →  internal/core/services/  →  internal/core/ports/
                                                          ←  internal/adapters/outbound/
```

- `internal/core/domain/` — pure domain types (`Task`, `TaskStatus`, `Session`, `Message`)
- `internal/core/ports/` — Go interfaces only (`LLMClient`, `TaskRepository`, `SessionRepository`, `FileWriter`, `Orchestrator`)
- `internal/core/services/` — business logic; depends only on ports; no goroutines here
- `internal/adapters/inbound/` — CLI (Cobra), HTTP API (chi), MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0), Wails GUI, system tray
- `internal/adapters/outbound/` — LM Studio, Ollama, SQLite, filesystem

### Agent files

| Role | Agent file |

## Counters

- **Next Task ID**: 208
- **Next Plan ID**: 30

---

## .claude System Conventions

- `orchestrator.json` — slim active registry; only non-done tasks + current plan + counters
- `.claude/tasks/TASK-NNN.md` — one file per task with YAML front-matter + implementation spec
- `.claude/plans/PLAN-NNN.md` — archived completed plans (written by `/archive-plan`)
- `.claude/commands/*.md` — slash commands invoked by Claude agents
- Completed tasks are removed from `orchestrator.json` when a plan is archived; the `.md` files are kept permanently as a record

## Key Learnings / Experiment Log

### SESSION 2026-03-12: PLAN-029 — Task Queue UI Fix + AI Session Deduplication & Cleanup

**Files changed**: 7 (DashboardView.vue, ports.go, ai_session_repo.go, orchestrator.go, server.go × 2, sessionMonitor.ts)  
**Tests**: all passing  
**Tasks**: TASK-203–207

#### Learnings

1. **Vue flex height chain** — A `flex-1` child inside a *block* container (`<div>` with no `display: flex`) gets no effective height. The parent wrapper must be `flex flex-col` for the child's `flex-1` and `h-full` to resolve. `overflow-auto` alone is insufficient. Fix: change the `DashboardView` wrapper from `<div class="flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-auto">` to `<div class="flex flex-col flex-1 min-h-0">`.

2. **Session dedup pattern** — For idempotent registration endpoints where external callers (e.g. VS Code extensions) heartbeat via POST, the correct architecture is:
   - Server: check `externalId` → if exists, update `lastActivity`, return existing record (no new row)
   - Client heartbeat: lightweight `POST /{id}/heartbeat` (204 No Content) instead of re-registering
   - Stale cleanup: background goroutine with TTL (5 min) + cleanup interval (2 min)
   - Fallback: if heartbeat receives 404, client re-registers (session was cleaned up server-side)

3. **Interface coverage rule** — When adding a new method to `ports.Orchestrator`, ALL of these locations must be updated:
   - `internal/core/services/orchestrator.go` (implementation)
   - `cmd/nexus-cli/main.go` (remote stub)
   - `internal/adapters/inbound/httpapi/server_test.go` (mock)
   - `internal/adapters/inbound/cli/root_test.go` (mock)
   - `internal/adapters/inbound/mcp/server_test.go` (mock) ← most often missed

4. **MCP test mock** — `mcp/server_test.go` is the most frequently missed location when extending the Orchestrator port. Always run `grep -r 'mockOrch\|mockOrchestrator' --include='*_test.go' .` before assuming coverage is complete.

#### Anti-patterns caught

- `heartbeat()` calling `detectAndRegister()` = always creates new sessions (O(n) row growth, 72+ sessions observed in production)
- `INSERT OR REPLACE` on primary key only ≠ dedup by `externalId` — requires a separate `UNIQUE` constraint on `external_id` OR an application-level lookup before insert

```
EXPERIMENT 2026-03-12: Tried re-registering on every heartbeat tick (detectAndRegister in heartbeat loop). Failed because it bypassed externalId dedup and created unbounded session rows. Used idempotent RegisterAISession (lookup-then-update) + dedicated HeartbeatAISession endpoint instead.
```
